# babelfish-go-driver

[babelfish doc](https://github.com/src-d/babelfish)

To get a request and reply a response, go-driver uses standard input and output.

To generate the binary to add to the container:

* $ mdkir /bin
* $ make clean && make

To run inside a container:

* $ docker build -t babelfish-go-driver .
* $ docker run --rm -i babelfish-go-driver

The directory driverclient/ contains a program to generate a single request and feed babelfish-go-driver for testing.
The directory driverout/ contains a program to retrieve the output generated by babelfish so you can see the "unmarshaled" response.

Demo:

* $ go run driverclient/main.go -f testfiles/test1.source | docker run --rm -i babelfish-go-driver | go run driverout/main.go
