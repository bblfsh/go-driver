# babelfish-go-driver

[babelfish doc](https://github.com/src-d/babelfish)

To get a request and reply a response, go-driver uses standard input and output.

To generate the binayr to add to the container:
$ mdkir /bin
$ go build -ldflags "-X main.driverVersion=beta-demo-0.9" main.go conf_nodes.go
$ mv main bin/babelfish-go-driver

To run inside a container:
$ docker build -t babelfish-go-driver
$ docker run -i babelfish-gp-driver

The directory driverclient/ contains a program to generate a single request and feed babelfish-go-driver for testing.
The directory driverout/ contains a program to retrieve the output generated by babelfish so you can see the "unmarshaled" response.

Demo:
$ go run driverclient/main.go -f testfiles/test1.go | docker run --rm -i babelfish-go-driver | go run driverout/main.go
